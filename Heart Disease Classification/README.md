**Predicting Heart Disease Using Logistic Regression**
**Overview**

Developed a binary classification model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a dataset from Kaggle. The project involved data preprocessing, model implementation, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
Key Responsibilities

    Data Collection & Preprocessing:
        Gathered a comprehensive heart disease dataset combining five different sources.
        Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships between features.
    Feature Engineering:
        Selected relevant features such as age, sex, chest pain type, and others.
        Ensured proper encoding of categorical data.
    Model Implementation:
        Implemented a logistic regression model from scratch in Python.
        Incorporated a sigmoid activation function and binary cross-entropy loss function.
    Training & Optimization:
        Trained the model using gradient descent.
        Tuned hyperparameters (learning rate and number of iterations) to optimize model performance.
    Evaluation:
        Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and specific evaluation metrics for binary classification.
        Visualized the loss over iterations to ensure convergence.

**Results**

    Achieved an accuracy of 74.79%, precision of 77.52%, recall of 76.34%, and an F1-score of 76.92%.
    Improved model performance through hyperparameter tuning and extensive evaluation.
